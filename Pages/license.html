		<h3 style="text-align: center;">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h3>
		<p style="text-align: center;">Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>

		<p>Copyright Â© 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
		 &lt;<a href="https://fsf.org/">https://fsf.org/</a>&gt;</p><p>
		  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
		   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

		 <h3><a name="preamble"></a>Preamble</h3>

		 <p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
		 software and other kinds of works.</p>

		 <p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
		 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
		 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
		 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
		 software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
		 GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
		 any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
		 your programs, too.</p>

		 <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
		 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
		 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
		 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
		 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
		 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>

		 <p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
		 these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
		 certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
		 you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>

		 <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
		 gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
		 freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
		 or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
		 know their rights.</p>

		 <p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
		 (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
		 giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>

		 <p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
		 that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
		 authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
		 changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
		 authors of previous versions.</p>

		 <p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
		 modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
		 can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
		 protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
		 pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
		 use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
		 have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
		 products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
		 stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
		 of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>

		 <p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
		 States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
		 software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
		 avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
		 make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
		 patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>

		 <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
		 modification follow.</p>
